The goal of the game is to take as many tricks as possible and reach a score of 10 or more first. The game is played in pairs. Your partner sits opposite to you and the deals are played clockwise. Each player is dealt five cards and the game starts by choosing a card suit.\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ FEATURES ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ advanced AI players\r\n✓ intuitive interface\r\n✓ balanced rules\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ TIPS ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓\tIn the first round you can choose the trump suit by choosing the card from the center pile. \r\n✓\tIf the current round passes without choosing the trump a second one follows.\r\n✓\tIn the second round you must choose any suit of cards except the one you passed in the round before.\r\n✓\tIf the trump is not chosen in these 2 rounds the cards are reshuffled and the game starts again without changing the dealer.\r\n✓\tOnce a trump suit is chosen the game can start. \r\n✓\tIf you choose a trump suit in the first round, the card in the center pile is passed to the dealer of the cards.\r\n✓\tIf you are the dealer of the cards, your name is marked with an encircled D. If the trump is chosen in the first round you receive the trump card and must shed any card you wish.\r\n✓\tThe player next to the dealer in a clock-wise direction is the first to choose a trump suit. \r\n✓\tIf that player passes the chance, the next one after him follows.\r\n✓\tThe game is played between two teams: a top-bottom team comprised of you and a computer player and a left-right team of computer players.\r\n✓\tThe player and his partner are called the makers if one of them chooses a trump suit. Otherwise they are called the defenders.\r\n✓\tTo win the makers must take at least 3 tricks. The defenders in order to win must take at least 3 tricks as well.\r\n✓\tIf the makers take 5 tricks they score 2 points. If the defenders take 3 or more tricks they score 2 points.\r\n✓\tIf the makers take 3 or 4 tricks they score 1 point. If the makers take less than 3 tricks they score 0 points.\r\n✓\tThere is the possibility of playing alone by pressing the -play alone- button when choosing the trump.\r\n✓\tWhen playing alone the team scores 4 points if the maker takes all 5 tricks. Otherwise if the team takes 3 or 4 tricks it scores only 1 point.\r\n✓\tThere is a specific order of the trump cards. The trump Jack is the most valuable card, followed by the Jack of the same-color suit. \r\n✓\tFor example if the trump suit is hearts, the most valuable card is the Jack of hearts followed by the Jack of diamonds.\r\n✓\tThese cards are followed by the Ace, the King, the Queen, the 10 and the 9. \r\n✓\tThere are only 24 cards in the deck - 6 from each suit.\r\n✓\tThe order of the cards in the other suits is the Ace, the King, the Queen, the Jack, the 10 and the 9.\r\n✓\tThe Jack of the same color as the trump suit makes part of the trump suit.\r\n✓\tYou can start the trick with any card but you must follow suit or play any other card if you cannot follow suit.\r\n✓\tThe trick is won by the player who plays the highest trump or the highest card of the starting suit.\r\n✓\tTo win the game you must be the first to score 10 or more points.\r\n✓\tThere is a statistics menu in which you can view the total games played, the percentage of won games, the number of rounds played, the number of euchres made.\r\n✓\tIf you as a defender take 3 or more tricks then you achieve a euchre.\r\n✓\tIf you as a maker take less than 3 tricks then you have been euchred.\r\n✓\tThe makers are marked with an M. The player that chose the trump is marked with a bold M.\r\n✓\tThe defenders are marked with a D.\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

Kingdoms is about forging alliances, political mind games, city-building and castle sieges with thousands of other players. Cast as a feudal lord or lady, players begin with a single village and keep. They must design and defend their castle before turning their eye to the rest of the country, Europe and the world! Whatever path they choose players will find strength in numbers as they band together, uniting with local Factions and player-led Houses.\r\n\r\nBesiege the castle that’s never been taken, overthrow ruthless tyrants, bankroll your faction’s war efforts, pillage your neighbor’s resources, peacefully raise cattle or do it all! Factions, elections, liege lords and their vassals come together to form a feudal community of real players with whom to discuss strategies and build allegiances.\r\n \r\nWhile an impregnable castle should be at the heart of any kingdom, you can also specialize with a vast research tree. Starting as a humble peasant each promotion provides valuable research points to spend on trading, diplomacy, warfare, farming or religion. Beware as your power grows so does your responsibility.

The king, unable to reconcile himself with the hopeless union, sent his son on a crusade and, in his absence, drove his young wife out of the castle. The king had counted on the fact that the prince would eventually forget about her, but his plans were ruined when his heir died in battle, and the prince’s beloved wife gave birth to a child and died in confinement.

We specialize in educational games with the fun built right into them.\r\n\r\nLet's do the rest of the description in a question-and-answer form.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ How is the game played? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nIn the first lesson, children listen to the names of colors while a fun brush puts a big splash of the color on an easel, accompanied by an entertaining sound effect that makes the splash against the easel sound real.\r\n\r\nThen children learn how to recognize colors with a series of colorful jellyfish that float down with likable expressions on their faces. The pleasant lady announcer asks kids to choose the blue, yellow, purple, or black jellyfish. Each time children choose the correct one, she congratulates them with encouraging words like \"Perfect!\" and \"You're Good!\"\r\n\r\nNext, children discover how to build their color memories. An identical, pretty design shows up on the screen in rows. When kids tap on one of the designs, a color is revealed. Then the color disappears behind the design. Kids keep tapping until they remember where some of the colors are. Then when they tap on a design that matches one of the colors they remember the location of, they go back and tap it.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nLike all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, your child will learn:\r\n\r\n✔ The names of colors by splashing colors onto an easel.\r\n\r\n✔ How to recognize colors by being asked to do things like \"Choose the purple jellyfish.\"\r\n\r\n✔ Build memory skills by matching a color they've just seen.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear from parents – and from children, too.

Score strikes, spares, and turkeys.\r\n\r\nPICK UP SPARES\r\n\r\nPractice challenging spares. Clear stages to unlock new balls.\r\n\r\nONE HUNDRED PINS\r\n\r\nKnock down as many pins as you can in 5 throws at a rack of 100 pins!\r\n\r\nCANDLEPIN BOWLING\r\n\r\nInvented in 1880. Candlepin bowling offers a great challenge. Candlepins are thin skittles that bounce and spin unpredictably when struck. Pins aren't cleared between rounds allowing you to knock them into still upright pins.\r\n\r\nFIVE PIN BOWLING\r\n\r\n Invented in 1904 in Canada. In 5 pin, each pin is worth different point values. Spares are strategic attempts to hit the most valuable pins. A perfect game is 450 points!\r\n\r\nNINE PIN (GERMAN BOWLING)\r\n\r\nInvented in medieval Germany, 9 pin is what most later bowling games are based on. Nine pins are arranged in a diamond shape with a \"kingpin\" in the middle. Knocking all the pins over earns 9 points. Knocking all the pins over but the kingpin earns 12!\r\n\r\nLONG ALLEY SKITTLES\r\n\r\nKnock over pins by throwing a barrel-shaped 'cheese'! To score points, you first have to knock over the kingpin. It's tricky to master when the ball bounces unpredictably!\r\n\r\nDUCK PIN\r\n\r\nInvented in 1904 in New England. Duck pin uses the nearly the same rules as 10 pin, but allows 3 rounds to knock over all the pins. The ball and pins are smaller making precision very important to score well!\r\n\r\nIRON PIN\r\n\r\nIron pin is the same as normal bowling but one random pin is much heavier than the others. Careful consideration has to be made on how to knock over the heavy pin while also clearing the normal ones.\r\n\r\nSHUFFLE BOWLING\r\n\r\nBowling on a shuffleboard table! Knock over the pins with a weighted puck.\r\n\r\nWEST COUNTY SKITTLES\r\n\r\nTraditional skittles game that has been played in British pubs for centuries.\r\n\r\nGalaxy Bowling has an option to purchase Candlepin, Duck Pin, Five Pin, Nine Pin, 100 pin, and Iron Pin variants. Ten pin, and spares mode are included free.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDKPHB","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Word Unscramble for Minecraft","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31901.9007199266533983.41f9c12a-ee88-4818-9471-150cadd1a757.e3803c09-03f0-4dec-9839-712fb9e1653d","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40520.9007199266533983.0bde4f97-a0ee-46d6-b063-af9e6e59412f.beb93456-3312-485d-90ba-8957acae8503","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37889.9007199266533983.af6e7ba5-827f-47f6-89c0-56133ab903c8.d732ec8d-00e5-40d5-96e6-d8fb52e99b89","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61735.9007199266533983.a039dee7-ad4f-4ed2-9bad-3067b9a366ef.1bdaf710-960d-4fdc-95ad-2595757869e8","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.0,"RatingsCount":"2","PackageFamilyNames":["43753JohnMartello.MinecraftScramble_ca15cjppyhbny"],"ContentIds":["3f86d5d9-bfc8-6718-d299-69bb4a44dade"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Do you like Word games?
